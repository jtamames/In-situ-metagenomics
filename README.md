We use Qiagen's DNeasy PowerSoil Pro Kit for extracting DNA, because it does not imply heating steps, which is best for us. The kit relies on a bead-beating step to mechanically lyse cells. Be gentle with that step, since it could lead to extensive DNA fragmentation, hampering library preparation afterwards.
